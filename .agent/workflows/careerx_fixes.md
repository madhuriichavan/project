# CareerX Fixes & Run Instructions

## Fixes Implemented
1.  **Backend Service Restoration**: Restored `GeminiAssessmentService.cs` which was missing from the codebase. This is critical for generating AI assessments.
2.  **Model Updates**: Added `McqQuestion` class to `Assessment.cs` to support the assessment flow.
3.  **Authentication Security**: Fixed a critical bug in `UsersController.cs` where new users were defaulting to `Admin` role. Now they correctly default to `Student`.
4.  **Configuration**: Corrected `SmtpHost` in `appsettings.json` to `smtp.gmail.com`.
5.  **Roadmap Generation**: Fixed Dependency Injection in `RoadmapController.cs` and improved robustness of Gemini JSON parsing.

## How to Run

### Frontend
1.  Navigate to `CarrerX_UI/CareerX_UI` directory.
2.  Install dependencies (if not already done):
    ```powershell
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the development server:
